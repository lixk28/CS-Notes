二分查找的判定树

+ Every search stops at some node: 
  + Successful at internal nodes, number of comparisons is the depth +1 (查找成功)
  + Unsuccessful at leaves, number of comparison is the depth of the leaf (查找失败)

+ For n+1 unsuccessful searches, the total number of comparisons is the external path length E(T), and the average is E(T)/(n+1).

+ The total number of comparisons for successful searches is I(T) + n, where I(T) is the internal path length (summing all depths of internal nodes), the average is I(T)/n + 1.

+ The external path length is denoted by E(T), and the internal path length is denoted by I(T)

  The connection between E(T) and I(T): For 2-trees E(T) = I(T) + 2q, q is the number of internal nodes. In this case q = n.

+ Let D(n) be the average external path length for binary search tree of n nodes, which has n+1 nodes

平衡二叉查找树

An AVL tree(Balanced Binary Tree 平衡二叉树) is indetical to a binary search tree in which (Inductive definition):

+ the height of the left and the right subtrees of the root differ by **<u>at most 1</u>** (Inductive base)
+ the left and the right subtrees are again AVL trees (Inductive step)

Height of AVL Tree:

Denote N~h~ the minimum number of nodes in an AVL Tree of height h, then the height of the AVL Tree can be defined like Fibonacci Sequence(closely related):

+ N~0~ = 1, N~1~ = 2

+ N~h~ = N~h-1~ + N~h-2~ + 1
