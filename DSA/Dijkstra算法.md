# Dijkstra Alogorithm

Problem: Given a weighted graph G=(V, E, W) in which each edge has a nonnegative weight or cost, find a path of least total weight from a given vertex u~0~, called the source, to every other vertex in the graph

The algorithm was discovered by Dijkstra in 1959

Basic Idea:
Suppose that S is a proper subset of V such that u~0~ $\in$ S and
