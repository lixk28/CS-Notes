# Note

My notes and references on some courses I choose in SYSU.  
I always take paper notes on math courses such as mathmatical analysis and discrete math, which will not be uploaded into this repository.  
I usually take electronic notes on most courses and lectures closely related to Computer Science, which is hard to take paper notes for me. And these notes will be uploaded.  
The repository is temporarily empty, and I plan to upload some files into it when have some free time.
